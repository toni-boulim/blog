Welcome to my cybersecurity and security engineering tutorials!

I will describe the techniques for the successful work of the red team, notes on penetration tests and programming exploits.

I will be write about:
- black box pentest
- lateral movement
- automation of red team scripts
- development and analysis of malware 

Most of the tutorials require a deep understanding of the Python and C ++ programming languages:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
