Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!

![book](/assets/images/62/2022-07-16_09-56.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Alhamdulillah, I finished writing this book today, while in the hospital with my daughter. It was quite difficult. In sha Allah everything will be fine. O Allah, Lord of the Worlds, give strength to my daughter.        

Why is the book called that? **MD** - means **M**alware **D**evelopment, The **MZ** signature is a signature used by the MS-DOS relocatable 16-bit EXE format and its still present in today's PE files for backwards compatibility., also **MD MZ** means **M**y **D**aughter **M**unira **Z**hassulankyzy.    

I will be very happy if this book helps at least one person to gain knowledge and learn the science of cybersecurity. The book is mostly practice oriented.

This book is dedicated to my wife, Laura, and my children, Yerzhan and Munira. Also, thanks to everyone who is helping me through these difficult times. The proceeds from the sale of this book will be used to treat Munira, who is currently battling for her life at a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey:

The book is divided into three logical chapters:    
- Malware development tricks and techniques    
- AV evasion tricks    
- Persistence techniques    

All material in the book is based on posts from my [blog](https://cocomelonc.github.io/)
